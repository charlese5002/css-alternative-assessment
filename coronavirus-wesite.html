        <p>
        Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s, but doctors didn't know where they come from. They get their name from their crown-like shape. Coronaviruses are most common in the fall and winter, but anyone can get a coronavirus infection at any time. As well as this, the Coronavirus can infect both animals and humans. This virus is transmitted by coughing, sneezing, touching an infected person, or touching objects that an infected person has touched. The current outbreak of the Coronavirus in China has lead scientists to believe it originated from bats or snakes that were consumed.
